# Notion Cards GH Action

This card updates a property from a page linked in a PR description. Commonly used to update the "Status" property of a
card used to keep track of features.

## How does it works?

A regex match is performed over the PR body. It matches the all URLs that has notion.so format in it, and then the ID
of the Card is extracted from the URL.
